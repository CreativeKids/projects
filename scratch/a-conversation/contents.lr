# Introduction {.intro}
In this project you will create a conversation between two or more characters. You will learn how to add sprites, a backdrop and how to properly sequence a conversation.

# Creative Challenges

Choose from one of the following creative challenges in order to complete this project (or design your own):

+ Create a conversation between **three** characters in which one of the characters is really small (hint: you will need to use the ![](larger.png) and ![](smaller.png) buttons to grow or shrink a sprite)

+ Create a conversation in which one of the characters is injured from falling out of a tree/truck/car

+ Create a conversation that features a joke

+ Your own creative challenge (please discuss with your teacher/supervisor before continuing)

# Step 1: Choose a setting {.activity}

First, choose a suitable backdrop to suit the theme of your story.

## Checklist {.check}

+ Click on  ![](scratch_background_icon.png) and choose a suitable backdrop for your conversation.

# Step 2: Choose your characters {.activity}
Choose the characters that you want in your story.

## Checklist {.check}

+ Click on ![](new-sprite.png) and choose each character you want in the conversation.

+ Place the characters in the scene as you want them. To face a character in the opposite direction, click on the 'Costumes' tab and click on the 'Flip left-right' button which looks like this: ![](flip-left-right.png)

# Step 3: Sequence the conversation
Now it is time to create the conversation. It may help you if you write down your conversation on paper first.

## Checklist {.check}

+ Select the sprite that will speak first. Drag out the following two blocks:

```blocks
when green flag clicked
say [Hello] for [2] secs
```

+ Click once in the 'Hello' section and type in the first sentence this character will say. 

+ Test your program works by clicking on the green flag ![](flag.png)

+ Now choose the next character that will speak and add the following three blocks:

```blocks
when green flag clicked
wait [2] secs
say [Hello] for [2] secs
```

+ Notice that we have to tell the character to wait two seconds before speaking. Change the 'Hello' to the first sentence this character will say. What would happen if you did not have this block?

+ Test that your program works by clicking on the green flag ![](flag.png)

+ Continue adding the sentences of your conversation to each of the characters, remembering to use the `wait` block so that the conversation is sequenced correctly.

+ When you are finished, test your program works by clicking on the green flag ![](flag.png)


## Finished? {.check}

+ When you are finished, share your creation in the [Scratch Project Gallery](../../../galleries/scratch)!

+ I'm done!
